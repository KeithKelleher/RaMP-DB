\usage{
runFisherTest(pathwaydf, total_metabolites = NULL, total_genes = 20000,
  analyte_type = "metabolites", min_analyte = 2, conpass = NULL,
  dbname = "ramp", username = "root", host = "localhost")
}
\arguments{
\item{pathwaydf}{a data frame resulting from rampFastPathFromMeta}

\item{total_metabolites}{number of metabolites analyzed in the experiment (e.g. background) (default is 1000; set to 'NULL' to retrieve total number of metabolites that map to any pathway in RaMP). Assumption that analyte_type is "metabolite")}

\item{total_genes}{number of genes analyzed in the experiment (e.g. background) (default is 20000, with assumption that analyte_type is "genes")}

\item{analyte_type}{"metabolites" or "genes" (default is "metabolites")}

\item{min_analyte}{if the number of analytes (gene or metabolite) in a pathway is
< min_analyte, do not report}

\item{conpass}{password for database access (string)}

\item{dbname}{name of the mysql database (default is "ramp")}

\item{username}{username for database access (default is "root")}

\item{host}{host name for database access (default is "localhost")}
}
\value{
a dataframe with pathway enrichment (based on Fisher's test) results
}
